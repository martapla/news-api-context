# News Search App.

For this project I used the `API`: https://newsapi.org/

##  👩‍🔧 Project Description 
The app features a main `search input`, enabling users to select the type of news they want to read. 
Upon selection, all corresponding cards are displayed. 
Clicking the `read more` button in each card opens a new tab with the news link.
